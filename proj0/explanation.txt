Strange Excuses
There were also some strange excuses in this year's survey. 


It’s too cold to work.
I had morning sickness (it was a man).
My coffee was too hot and I couldn’t leave until it cooled off.
An astrologer warned me of a car accident on a major highway, so I took all backroads, making me an hour late.
My dog ate my work schedule.
I was here, but I fell asleep in the parking lot.
My fake eyelashes were stuck together.
Although it has been five years, I forgot I did not work at my former employer’s location and drove there on accident.
More Bizarre Excuses
Other excuses reported in an earlier survey were equally weird:

Employee claimed a zebra was running down the highway and held up traffic (turned out to be true)
